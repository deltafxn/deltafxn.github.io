Go to your new project and select the ‘Data’ tab in the project. This will take you to the data overview.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_data_overview.png" style="cursor:nw-resize"></p>
<p>To see and/or start labelling a video, click the ‘Label’ button. This will take you to the Editor view.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor.png"></p>
<p>Here we can play the video directly, navigate it frame by frame, or by a chosen frame skip interval that you can configure at the bottom of the video navigation.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_frame_skip.png"></p>
<p>We can also see the label options in the lefthand panel reflecting the ontology you setup in the project creation. Instantiate the labels directly through the hotkeys that appear on the right of the labels.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_create_labels.png"></p>
<p>In general, you can review all hotkeys by clicking on the keyboard icon in the upper panel. This menu will update as you add new labels in the video and will be a useful guide to get familiar with.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_hotkeys.png"></p>
<p>Now let’s start labelling.  Click on the object or classification you want to add on the left panel(or use the appropriate hotkey) to instantiate a new object or classification of that type. The drawing cursor will appear and you can now draw the object directly on the frame.</p>
<p><img src="/img/cursor_bb.gif"></p>
<p>It is important to note that for objects, instantiating from ‘Create New Labels’ creates a new unique object of that type. To draw a label for an object that already exists, find the object under the ‘Video Labels’ panel(first expand the labels by pressing the plus button) and click on it(or use the appropriate hotkey). This will allow you to draw consistent tracks of objects across the video.</p>
<p>To propagate an object from frame A to frame B you have many options: draw the object from clicking it in the Video Labels(or using the appropriate hotkey), copy the object in frame A and paste it in frame B and then adjust it accordingly, or use our automated features.</p>
<p>Automated Labelling</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_tracking_interpolation.png"></p>
<p>To get started with our automated labelling features, click on the Automated Labelling button to expand the Automated Labelling drawer. Here you will find ‘Classification’, ‘Detection and Segmentation’, and ‘Tracking and Interpolation.’ Let’s learn how to propagate an object through frames with tracking and interpolation.</p>
<p>To review, our tracking algorithms will try to follow the object through frames using the pixel information enclosed in the object boundary. All tracking algorithms propagate boxes forward through frames, objects in lower number frames can only be tracked to higher number frames. Interpolation, by contrast, works by interpolating the box or polygon boundary itself in between frames where they are drawn.</p>
<p>Let’s first try to track an object. First pick the objects you want tracked under ‘Video labels’. You can pick as many objects as you want to run the tracker with.</p>
<p><img src="/img/tracking_gif.gif"></p>
<p>The ‘Tracking annotation interval’ is a parameter for how many frames you want the tracker to run after it sees an object. It will thus stop that particular track after the number of frames specified. Tracking range specifies which part of the video you are working on, to avoid the algorithm from running on the whole video. By setting the tracking range to a specified, the tracker will only consume and produce labels within that interval.</p>
<p>So for example:
We have a bounding box for Object A drawn on frames 10 and 40. Setting the ‘Tracking range’ [10,40] and the ‘Tracking Annotation Interval’ to 30 you will get Object A on all frames 10-40.</p>
<p>Setting the ‘Tracking Range’ [20,40] and ‘Tracking Interval’ to 30 you will get no additional instances of Object A added because the ‘Tracking Range’ will miss the annotated object on frame 10.</p>
<p>Setting the ‘Tracking Annotation Interval’ to 20 and ‘Tracking Range [10,40] you will get Object A on frames 10-30 and on frame 40 since the tracker will run 20 frames from frame 10 and then stop that track.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_tracking_parameters.png"></p>
<p>You can also run the tracker directly from the hotkeys. Highlight the object you want to track and press ‘Ctrl + t’ to run the tracker on that object. The tracker will run from the frame you are on and will default to a ‘Tracking Interval’ of 30 frames. This default can be altered through the Settings icon in the upper right panel.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_settings.png"></p>
<p>Finally, you can select different possible tracking algorithms under ‘Advanced Settings’.  We offer ‘Advanced’ , ‘Standard’, and ‘Simple’ as selections. ‘Advanced’ tends to have the highest tracking accuracy but is the slowest in terms of computation time. ‘Simple’ runs very quickly but has the lowest accuracy. ‘Standard’ sits in between ‘Advanced’ and ‘Simple’ in both speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Now let’s run interpolation. Again select as many objects as you want interpolated.  The ‘Interpolation Range’ is the range of frames in the video the algorithm will run on. If there are at least two instances of an object you selected within the range of frames you set, the interpolation will fill in all empty frames in between these instances.</p>
<p>Note, interpolation works for both bounding boxes and polygons.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_interpolation.png"></p>
<p>We have seen now how to draw and propagate objects through our label editor. Let’s take a look at frame level Classifications.</p>
<p>You can instantiate a new classification from the left handle panel in ‘Create new label’(or use the appropriate hotkey).  Initiate the classification value from the panel whether ‘Text’, ‘Radio’,’Checklist’ or a nested classification.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_classifications.png"></p>
<p>Initiating a classification will create a frame range above the video player bar which you can use to set the frames for which this classification applies.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_classifications_range.png"></p>
<p>You can either enter the frame numbers directly within the range bracket on the lower left of the range bar, drag the ranges in the range bar, or set the range values to the current frame through ‘Set end to current’ and ‘Set start to current’ buttons.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_classifications_multi_range.png"></p>
<p>If the classification has multiple disconnected frame ranges, use the ‘Add range’ and ‘Remove range’ buttons to manipulate the set of ranges to get to values that apply.</p>
<p>Once the classification is set, you can view the values in the left panel under ‘Video labels’. An overview of the frames that classification appears in will be displayed in the bar. Hover over it to find the exact frame ranges.</p>
<p><img src="/img/label_editor_classifications_view.png"></p>
<p>Once you want to stop annotating the video, set the status of the video with the check mark button in the top panel. We can set this video to ‘In progress’ since we have added some labels but have not completed labelling the entire video.</p>
